## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
    Create Full Stack Employee Management system using Spring Boot and React.js. In this video we will use Spring Boot ( MVC, JPA, Hibernate) and Mysql Database to create the Backend application (Restful web service API) with and use React.js to create the frontend application.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Prerequisites
You need to install

  *Node.js
  
  *Eclipse IDE
  
  *MySql Database
    
  *VS Code
  
  For testing API
  
  *POSTMAN  
  


### Installing

You‚Äôll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it‚Äôs not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

npx
npx create-react-app my-app
(npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

npm
npm init react-app my-app
npm init <initializer> is available in npm 6+
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

cd my-app
Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

npm start or yarn start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
